 # This project simulates a basic cross-platform security scenario where a network scan is initiated from a Windows machine targeting an Ubuntu host. 
  **The objective is to observe how scan activity appears from the attacker perspective** 
  **and how it can be manually detected and analyzed on the target system through log inspection**

## The lab focuses on fundamental concepts of:

- Network scanning and service discovery

- Cross-platform interaction (Windows → Ubuntu)

- Manual log review and detection techniques

- Understanding attacker–defender perspective in a controlled environment

- All activities were performed in a personal lab environment.
