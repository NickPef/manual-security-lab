# windows-zenmap-initiated-scan-and-ubuntu-manual-log-detection
-- This project simulates a basic cross-platform security scenario where a network scan is initiated from a Windows machine targeting an Ubuntu host
-- The objective is to observe how scan activity appears from the attacker perspective
-- and how it can be manually detected and analyzed on the target system through log inspection
